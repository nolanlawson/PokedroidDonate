    <string name="install_free_text">Pokédroid Donate is simply an add-on to the free Pokédroid, meaning you\'ll still need to install that version in order for it to work. Once you do, this icon will disappear. Thanks for donating! :)</string>
    <string name="thanks">While installed, Pokédroid Donate simply serves as proof that you donated.  It also changes the text in the \"About\" section.  This icon will remove itself from your application tray the next time you reboot. Thanks for donating - you are awesome! :)</string>
